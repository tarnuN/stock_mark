# Stock Portfolio Tracker
## Overview
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a web-based application that allows users to manage their stock investments efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface to view, add, edit, and delete stock data, as well as calculate the total value of a user's stock portfolio dynamically. The application is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js/Express** for the backend, with data stored in **MySQL** database.

### Key Features:
- **Add Stock**: Add new stocks with essential details like name, ticker symbol, quantity, buy price, and current price.
- **Edit Stock**: Modify existing stock details such as quantity, buy price, and name.
- **Delete Stock**: Remove stocks from the portfolio.
- **Total Portfolio Value**: Dynamically calculate the total value of the portfolio based on live stock prices fetched from the Alpha Vantage API.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly, providing an optimal experience across various devices.

## Limitations
- **API Request Limit**: The free version of Alpha Vantage API allows only 5 requests per minute. This means:
  - You can only fetch current prices for 5 different stocks per minute
  - Additional requests will be rejected until the minute window resets
